# Business Context

Airbnb is a somewhat recent company that offers vacation rental services. Additionally, it offers coverage of 193 countries with more than 2 million properties and is perhaps the most popular and used. It is a safe application, at least I speak from my experience, yes, I have used it too. Of all the times I have used it I have only had one bad experience and that was in New York (the room I rented was not at all the one in the pictures on the app). But well, this motivated me to dig a little deeper with this data and find out what are those things that we should all look at before renting an Airbnb and guarantee a good experience.

On the other hand, we will also study the relationship that the price has with some of the variables we have available, such as the neighborhood, the number of rooms, people's reviews, among others. We will try to predict the price of each Airbnb according to its characteristics. In this way we will try to avoid the risk of the host setting prices too high or too low and thus increase the probability of acquiring more customers.

Goals
* Predict the price of each Airbnb offered by hosts and in this way try to help them to have more listings by decreasing the risk of charging the wrong price.

* Delivering inputs for hosts with low earnings and making their listings more profitable and earning more revenue.

* Investigate the influence of some variables on the price of each Airbnb
